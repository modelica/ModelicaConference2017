<b>Abstract:</b>The paper proposes an extension of FMI 2.0 for the rigorous treatment of discrete-time models. This includes the introduction of discrete-time states, the declaration of clocks in the model description and an extension of the calling interface for the external activation of clocks by an importing environment.

The synchronous discrete-time extension enables for the first time the synchronization of FMUs with the environment and with other FMUs. It specializes the existing generic event mechanism of FMI 2.0 and maps to synchronous features of Modelica.

Discrete-time FMUs are needed for the generation of controller code from functional models. This paper outlines different use cases, including a simple PI controller, feed forward control with a nonlinear inverse model and nonlinear model predictive control.

The FMI change proposal FCP-001 and the Modelica change proposal MCP-0024 describe the proposed extensions in more detail. Test implementations exist in the simulation tools Dymola and OpenModelica and in the importing optimization solver HQP. The use cases given in this paper served for further refinement of the change proposals and the test implementations.<br />
